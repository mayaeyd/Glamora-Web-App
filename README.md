Glamora - Makeup Products Showcase

Glamora is a web application designed to showcase makeup products with a visually appealing interface. Users can browse products by type and brand, view detailed information, and explore product images. Each product is displayed in stylish cards featuring image backgrounds, names, prices, and color indicators.

Built with Express.js, EJS, and CSS, this project uses the Makeup API (http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) to fetch product data. This API provides public, no-auth access to a wide range of makeup products. Special thanks to the creators of the Makeup API for their valuable resource.
